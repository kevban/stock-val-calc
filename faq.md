# FAQ
## What is this valuation methodology?
The goal of the valuation is to determine what it the % annual return if you purchase the stock now, everything goes according to your forecast, and you sell it at the end of the forecast period. The computed target price is the implied share price at the end of the forecast period, plus any dividend you receive from now to that day.
## Why is FCF ignored?
In theory, FCF should be available to shareholders after the firm's needs. However, shareholders do not actually have access to this amount. From the perspective of a retail investor in public stock, only dividends and share appreciation are actual returns of the investment. Therefore, FCF is excluded from the valuation to simplify the process and reflect actual returns.
## Why is there no discount rate?
Discount rate is used to represent the required return to compensate for the risk of the investment. However, the actual required return for an individual investor should be determined by the investor themselves. There are methods to estimate the appropriate required return relative the to the market (e.g. CAPM), but many of their underlying assumptions may not be applicable to the investor. Therefore, the returns are not discounted to make the process more understandable for the average investor, and for reasons mentioned above. Instead, the calculated annual return can be compared to a hurdle rate if the investor wish to use the required return approach.
## What about share repurchases?
Share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and increase share price. To model this, investor can reduce the shares outstanding in forecast period to calculate new share price after the repurchase. Currently, the app does not include this feature.
## Should I trust the result?
You absolutely should not trust the result. Even wallstreet experts rarely get the valuation right despite their years of knowledge and sophisticated models. The goal of this valuation is to see what has to happen for the stock to achieve your desired level of return, and evaluate your risk vs return based on the results.
