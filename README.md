# Stock Valuation Calculator
A web app that allows user to quickly calculate intrinsic value of publically traded stocks through a fundamental analysis in less than a minute!
## What does it do?
By searching any stock ticker, the app will quickly pull up historical financial information from prior period financial statements, and populate a financial forecast model with some default assumptions. From here, the user can adjust the model assumptions, and calculate the intrinsic value of a stock. The user can also reference other user's forecasts to compare with their assumptions.
## How to use?
1. Begin by searching a publically traded stock ticker (e.g. MSFT)
2. Click 'Start Valuation'
3. Adjust inputs if needed.
4. The target price and return will be automatically calculated at the bottom of the page.
5. Signup and save your forecast for future reference!
